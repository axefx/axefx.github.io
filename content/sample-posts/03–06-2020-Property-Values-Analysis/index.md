# 2019 Property values in Diamond Bar, CA

## Overview

In 2019, as provided by the [Los Angeles county data portal](https://data.lacounty.gov/Parcel-/Assessor-Parcels-Data-2019/csig-gtr7), there were 46,756 accessor parcel records for the zip code 91765.
Within the zip code 91765 the main city located there is Diamond Bar, CA. As I continued my analysis my main question was what is the average price of homes and how affordable are they.
